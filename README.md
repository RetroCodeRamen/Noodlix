### 🔐 Initial Setup and Security

When you first open your ramen shop, you'll get a default root account:

3. Create additional user accounts with `useradd`
4. Keep your root credentials secret - they're like your master ramen recipe!
5. Make your password as strong as a well-cooked noodle:
   - Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
   - Add some numbers for flavor
   - Throw in some special characters
   - Make it at least 12 characters long
